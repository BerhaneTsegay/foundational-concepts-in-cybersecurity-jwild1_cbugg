## Resource Encapsulation

Resource Encapsulation requires program and system designers to limit access to resources to only those systems/processes whom require access. 

TODELETE:
A computer has many resources. A resource can be hardware based such as memory, disk drives, or a monitor. It can also be system objects such as semaphores, a linked list, or shared memory. 

Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. An example, assume a flag pole is the object. There are fixed methods on how the flag pole is to be used. Put the flag on, take the flag off, raise or lower the flag. Nothing else can be done to the flag pole. 

In addition to controlling what operations can be performed on the resource, the system can also control which users can perform these operations on the resource.
