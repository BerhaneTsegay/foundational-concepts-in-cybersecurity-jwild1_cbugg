# Foundational Concepts in Cybersecurity
#### Jwild1 & Cbugg | COSC 4010 | 10/10/17

**Assignment:**

Create a repository with code, graphics, and textual descriptions of the 10 Foundational Concepts in Cybersecurity. Code should represent both a functional example of the concept as well as a non-example. Textual descriptions should reference both the code and the graphics. 

**Topics with breif description:**
1. Domain Separation
    - Domain Separation involves separating access between processes/machines and the data and or resources they should have access to. 
2. Process Isolation
    - Process Isolation requires the operating system to keep seperate the resources each process needs to operate. 
3. Resource Encapsulation
    - Resource Encapsulation requires program and system designers to limit access to resources to only those systems/processes whom require access.

~~4. Least Privilege~~

5. Modularity
    -One mind any weapon
    
    
~~6. Layering~~

~~7. Abstraction~~

~~8. Data Hiding~~

9. Simplicity
    -The minimization of incidental complexity.

10. Minimization
    - limiting the places where users and other programs can enter or extract data.

**Making it:**

Be in the root directory, and type:
~~~
